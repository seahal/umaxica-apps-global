    # scheme on an HTTPS-only application.
    #
    # Every fetch in src/controllers/ targets a same-origin endpoint supplied
    # through a data attribute; the only cross-origin XHR is Cloudflare
    # Turnstile, which is already trusted in script-src and frame-src. The app
    # defines no ActionCable channels and no browser WebSocket client, so no
    # ws/wss source is needed.

    # `@vite/client` opens an HMR WebSocket to the Vite dev server, which listens on its own port of
    # the requested host. The sources are lambdas so the host is the one the browser actually used
    # rather than a hardcoded origin, and the port is the single dev-server port and nothing else.
    # Development only: no other environment runs a dev server, and production keeps `connect-src`
    # to same-origin plus Turnstile so an injected script has nowhere to send data.
    #
    # Rails resolves a dynamic source with `context.instance_exec`, where the context is
    # `request.controller_instance || request` (ContentSecurityPolicy::Middleware#call). Only the
    # controller answers `request`; when no controller handled the response -- an exception page, a
    # middleware reply, a static file -- the context is the `ActionDispatch::Request` itself, and
    # calling `request` there raises NameError while the header is being built.
