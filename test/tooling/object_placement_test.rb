# `app/services` had become a support root rather than a layer: 236 files carrying 115 distinct
# name suffixes, of which only 9 ended in `service`. Nothing distinguished a service from anything
# else filed beside it, because only 46 of those files inherit ApplicationService and the root is
# flat, so neither the type nor the path carried the role.
#
# This test pins the half of the placement rule that is mechanically checkable: a suffix owned by
# another root must not appear under `app/services`. It reads the filesystem rather than loading
# Rails, so it runs without a database or the compose environment.
#
# PENDING lists the files still awaiting their migration issue. Shrinking it is the point: each
# migration issue deletes its entries, which turns this test red until the files actually move.
# Do not add entries to make the suite green - see project/regression-guards.mdc.
