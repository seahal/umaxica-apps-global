# Builds the persisted email records the OTP delivery path takes as its `record:`.
#
# The records must be persisted rather than instantiated, because the Noticed
# delivery path serializes the recipient through GlobalID. A non-persisted record
# would fail at enqueue time in a way the legacy mailer path never exercised.
