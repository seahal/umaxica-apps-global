# Docs ADR Plans English Translation Implementation Notes

## Context

- Original request: translate Japanese content under `docs/`, `adr/`, and `plans/` into English.
- Related docs: `AGENTS.md`, `docs/index.md`, `notes/README.md`,
  `.agents/harnesses/rules/generic/implementation-notes.mdc`.
- Implementation date: 2026-05-20.

## Decisions Made During Implementation

- Decision: Translate only documentation paths requested by the user: `docs/`, `adr/`, and `plans/`.
  - Why: The request targeted documentation families, not application code or tests.
  - Alternatives considered: translating all repository files was rejected because it could affect
    fixtures, code examples, locale data, or user-facing strings.
  - Follow-up needed: human review should clean up machine-translation phrasing where docs are
    actively used as implementation specs.

- Decision: Use a cached Google Translate pass for the bulk conversion, then manually fix remaining
  Japanese strings and obvious machine-translation artifacts.
  - Why: The Japanese content spanned thousands of documentation lines, making manual translation in
    one pass error-prone.
  - Alternatives considered: fully manual translation was rejected for throughput; code-only regex
    replacement was insufficient for prose.
  - Follow-up needed: run focused review on high-value active plans before implementation depends on
    exact wording.

## Deviations From Plan

- Change: Fenced code block comments and sample error messages were translated after the initial
  pass left Japanese text there.
  - Why: The final verification target was no Japanese text in `docs/`, `adr/`, or `plans`.
  - Risk: Some sample code comments and example strings may now be less idiomatic than hand-written
    English.
  - Follow-up: clean up individual files opportunistically when they become active implementation
    inputs.

## Review Notes

- Tests run:
  - Japanese-character grep over `docs`, `adr`, and `plans`
  - Placeholder grep over `docs`, `adr`, and `plans`
  - `git diff --check -- docs adr plans`
- Tests not run: application tests were not run because this was documentation-only.
- Documentation or ADR promotion needed: none.
