# Object Placement Inventory

Audit of where non-model, non-controller objects actually live, and what they actually are. Input
for the placement work tracked in #858. This is a memo: exploratory audit output, not source of
truth (`project/repository-knowledge-tree.mdc`).

Counts were regenerated from the tree on 2026-08-29 and will drift as the moves land.

## Method, and its limits

Each file's role was derived from three signals rather than from its name:

1. Superclass or `module_function`.
2. Whether any ActiveRecord write appears anywhere in the body (`create`, `update`, `save`,
   `destroy`, `delete_all`, `upsert`, `touch`, `transaction`, and the bang variants).
3. The public method list.

Files whose suffix and body disagreed were then opened and read. **The confidence column says which
is which**: `high` means the body was read during this audit, `med` means the signals were
unambiguous and consistent, `low` means the file must be opened before it is moved. 30 rows are
high, 165 med, 41 low.

The signal pass is a first cut, not a verdict. A `med` row is a hypothesis with evidence, and the
issue that moves the file is responsible for confirming it.

## Root counts

| Root              | Files |
| ----------------- | ----- |
| `app/policies`    | 383   |
| `app/services`    | 236   |
| `app/values`      | 96    |
| `app/adapters`    | 23    |
| `app/errors`      | 19    |
| `app/lib`         | 10    |
| `app/presenters`  | 6     |
| `app/notifiers`   | 5     |
| `app/validators`  | 4     |
| `app/forms`       | 3     |
| `app/operations`  | 3     |
| `app/subscribers` | 3     |
| `app/queries`     | 2     |
| `app/resolvers`   | 1     |
| `app/consumers`   | **0** |

`app/consumers` exists and is empty while 8 `*_consumer.rb` sit in `app/services`.

## How the drift stayed invisible

- Of 236 files in `app/services`, only **46** inherit `ApplicationService`. 158 are plain classes
  with no superclass and 13 are `module_function` modules. There is no type to check, so nothing
  distinguished a service from anything else filed beside it.
- The 236 files carry **115 distinct name suffixes**. Only **9** end in `service`.
- Because the root is flat (`docs/architecture/flat-ruby-source-layout.md`), a file's path says
  nothing about its role either. Role lived only in the suffix, and the suffix was never enforced.

## Where the roles actually fall

| Role       | Files | Target root                           |
| ---------- | ----- | ------------------------------------- |
| Operation  | 106   | `app/operations`                      |
| Service    | 31    | `app/services`                        |
| Value      | 19    | `app/values`                          |
| Resolver   | 11    | `app/resolvers`                       |
| Store      | 11    | undecided, see #867                   |
| Verifier   | 11    | `app/adapters` or `app/lib`, see #866 |
| REVIEW     | 11    | undecided                             |
| Lib        | 8     | `app/lib`                             |
| Consumer   | 8     | `app/consumers`                       |
| Policy     | 8     | `app/policies`                        |
| Query      | 6     | `app/queries`                         |
| Adapter    | 3     | `app/adapters`                        |
| Registry   | 2     | `app/values`                          |
| Serializer | 1     | `app/serializers`                     |

**31 of 236 files are Services under this repository's own definition.** The root is 87 percent
things that are not services.

## Corrections to earlier estimates

The audit contradicts figures used when the issues were filed. The issues are wrong where they
disagree with this memo.

- **"50 write-side files" (#868) is an undercount, and the group is not homogeneous.** 106 files
  perform a state change. But `Issuer` is at least two different roles: `AcmeRefreshTokenIssuer`
  rotates a persisted token (`update_columns`, reuse handling) and is an Operation, while
  `JumpRtIssuer`, `OidcIdTokenIssuer` and `IdentityStepUpCeremonyResultIssuer` only build and sign a
  payload and persist nothing. The latter are primitives, not operations, and belong in `app/lib`. A
  bulk move keyed on the `Issuer` suffix would have put them in the wrong root.
- **"14 stores" (#867) is three different things.** Seven `*_replay_store` files pair
  `.for(surface)` dispatch with `create_transaction!` / `find_transaction!`. Three
  `*_candidate_store` files are genuine keyed stores with a `store! / fetch! / consume! / delete`
  lifecycle. `dpop_proof_state_store.rb` is neither: its whole body is a `case` returning an
  ActiveRecord class, which makes it a Resolver whose suffix is simply wrong.
  `turnstile_replay_store.rb` is a single write (`consume!`), so it is an Operation.
- **"4 validators" was wrong; there are 3** — `dbsc_proof_validator.rb`, `dpop_proof_validator.rb`,
  `oidc_authorize_request_validator.rb`.

## Correction to the placement rule written in #859

Three suffixes admitted by the rule are contradicted by the code they were meant to describe. The
rule needs a follow-up amendment; it should not be treated as settled on these points.

- **`Guard` and `Authority` are allowed under `app/policies`, but the objects carrying those names
  write.** `BaseSelectorBootstrapAuthority` runs `create` and `find_or_create_by` inside a
  transaction. `SignUpEmailPendingGuard` takes a lock and saves. `DpopJtiReplayGuard.record!`
  persists a replay entry. `SignRiskEnforcer` exposes `revoke!` and `require_step_up!`. A Policy is
  defined as having no side effects, so either these names leave `app/policies` or the rule stops
  admitting them.
- **`Locator` is allowed under `app/queries`, but both locators write.** `SignInCycleLocator` and
  `SignUpCycleLocator` expose `issue!`, `rotate!`, and `clear!`.

## `app/services` is not actually flat

`docs/architecture/flat-ruby-source-layout.md` names `app/services` as a flat root, but **20 of the
236 files are nested and namespaced**: `AvatarBackfill::`, `AvatarProvisioning::`,
`CollectiveMembership::` (7 files), `GroupAvatarMemberships::` (3), `GroupManagement::` (3), and
`Webauthn::` (4).

This matters for every move issue. A file in the flat part keeps its constant when it moves to
another flat root, so the move is a `git mv`. A file in the nested part does not, and neither does a
flat file moving into a nested root. The two halves need different handling and the count is not
small enough to treat as a footnote.

The nested group is also the most consistently named part of the root -
`CollectiveMembership::Accept`, `GroupManagement::Archive` - and those names carry no role suffix at
all, so applying the suffix rule to them is a constant rename on top of a move.

## Objects that need a decision, not a move

- `authentication_session_committer.rb` calls `controller.send(:establish_signed_in_session!)`. It
  reaches back into the controller and uses `send` to bypass a private method. The dependency runs
  the wrong way and the privacy boundary is deliberately circumvented; relocating the file changes
  neither.
- `chronicle_fallback_recorder.rb` is named `Recorder` but its `call` only writes
  `Rails.logger.error`. Under `adr/application-logging-boundary.md` a log is not the authoritative
  record, so a "recorder" that only logs is either misnamed or is a deliberate degraded path that
  should say so. Resolve with #869.
- `acme_selectable_context.rb` exposes `selectable_candidates` alongside `persist_selection!`: a
  query and a write in one object.
- `social_auth_callback_state_store.rb` pairs `issue!` / `consume!` with `state_class_for` dispatch
  — the same mixed shape as the replay stores.

## Non-values living in `app/values`

`app/values` holds 96 files. These are not values:

| File                                                                                                                                                                                            | What it is                       | Target               |

20 files end in `_result.rb`, which is already the Result Object convention and needs no change.

## Unsuffixed files in roles that require a suffix

- `app/operations/publishing/move_taxonomy_subtree.rb`, `promote_revision.rb`, `restore_version.rb`
- `app/presenters/auth/app/settings/activity_log.rb` and its `com`, `org`, and `base/*` siblings
- `app/queries/current_banner.rb`, `step_up_configured_methods.rb`
- `app/notifiers/notify/otp_issuance.rb`

## Dependency inversion

16 constants defined under `app/services` are referenced from `app/models`:

```
AdministrativeAccessLock AuthMethodGuard AuthenticationCredentialInventory
ChronicleFallbackRecorder ChronicleIntentWriter ChronicleInvalidator ChronicleRecorder
ChronicleResultWriter EnforcementIdentifierDigest IdentifierBlindIndex
IdentityTelephoneCeremony OidcClientRegistry PromotionalEmailUnsubscribeToken
RetentionCrossDatabaseChildPurge SignUpRequirementRegistry WithdrawalPersonalDataAnonymizer
```

12 are referenced from `app/models/concerns` — the same list without `AuthMethodGuard`,
`ChronicleRecorder`, `EnforcementIdentifierDigest`, and `RetentionCrossDatabaseChildPurge`.

Reproduce with:

```bash
find app/services -name '*.rb' | sed 's#app/services/##;s#\.rb$##;s#/#_#g' \
  | awk -F_ '{s="";for(i=1;i<=NF;i++){s=s toupper(substr($i,1,1)) substr($i,2)}; print s}' | sort -u > /tmp/svc.txt
grep -rhoE '\b[A-Z][A-Za-z0-9]+\b' app/models --include='*.rb' | sort -u > /tmp/m.txt
comm -12 /tmp/svc.txt /tmp/m.txt
```

Most of these are not services, so the inverted arrow is an artifact of placement and disappears
when the object moves: `IdentifierBlindIndex` and `EnforcementIdentifierDigest` are HMAC primitives
for `app/lib`, `OidcClientRegistry` and `SignUpRequirementRegistry` are catalogs for `app/values`,
`AuthenticationCredentialInventory` is a query, `ChronicleRecorder` is sanitization and retention
policy with no writes at all.

`AuthMethodGuard` is a narrower case still: `app/models/client.rb:307` references only its frozen
`VERIFIED_EMAIL_STATUSES` constant, not its behavior. The status lists are a value; extracting them
removes the dependency without moving the guard at all.

Three do not dissolve that way and are genuine violations: `ChronicleIntentWriter`,
`ChronicleResultWriter`, and `ChronicleInvalidator` all write, and all are called from
`app/models/concerns/chronicle_capturable.rb`. #869 covers them.
