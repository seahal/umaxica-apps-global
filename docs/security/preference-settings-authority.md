# Preference And Settings Authority

## Authority

`acme/www` owns preference writes, account lifecycle, withdrawal, and dashboards.

`acme/www` owns the general identity/settings shell, preference writes, account lifecycle,
withdrawal, and session-management UI. `sign/id` owns only credential/provider ceremonies: passkeys,
TOTP, Google, and Apple.

Signed-in Sign `/settings` is being retired as a general settings surface. The remaining
credential/provider ceremonies stay on Sign. General identity/settings flows now belong to Acme
`/identity`.

Telephone registration, withdrawal, sessions, secrets, emails, birthdate, activities, and MFA policy
are Acme-owned identity surfaces. Acme should read MFA inventory from a summary or domain-service
boundary instead of depending on Sign controller behavior.

Sign-side tests for the moved routes are boundary tests that verify redirect or gone behavior. They
are not compatibility tests for the retired general settings UI.

## Physical Storage

Existing sign-side preference, settings-shell, dashboard, or credential-management
tables/models/routes do not imply sign-side authority for persisted preference data. Physical DB
movement is out of scope for this implementation phase.

## Runtime Reads

Request-local preference reads may continue through existing runtime projection mechanisms while the
logical writer changes to acme. A read-side preference projection is not a write authority.
