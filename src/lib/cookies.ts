// Reading the cookies Rails publishes to the browser on purpose, through the Cookie Store API.
//
// The authoritative preference state lives in the verified preference JWT, which is httponly and
// so unreadable here. Alongside it the server writes small JS-readable projections - the theme in
// `ct`, the recorded consent decision in `preference_consented` - precisely so the first paint can
// be correct before any request is made.
//
// They are read here and never written. A projection written by this file would be a second source
// of truth for a decision the server owns, and consent is the last state that should have two.
//
// `document.cookie` parsing is deliberately gone: it is a synchronous string split that every
// caller had to re-implement or import a helper for, and it cannot tell an absent cookie from one
// this document may not see. `window.cookieStore` answers the same question as a structured record
// and is Baseline since June 2025 (Chrome/Edge 87+, Firefox 140+, Safari 18.4+). It exists only in
// a secure context, which every deployed surface is and `localhost` development counts as.
