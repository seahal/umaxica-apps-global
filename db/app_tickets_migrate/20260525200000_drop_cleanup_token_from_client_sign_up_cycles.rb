class DropCleanupTokenFromClientSignUpCycles < ActiveRecord::Migration[8.2]
  disable_ddl_transaction!

  # cleanup_token was added as an "cleanup ownership marker" intended to bind
  # the cleanup actor to the cycle, but no service ever consulted it. The
  # callback that populated it and the validation are removed; the column +
  # index are dropped here. See plans/backlog/retention-vocabulary-drift-cleanup.md.
