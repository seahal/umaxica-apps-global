  # ArtifactCleanup retries failed cleanups indefinitely if nothing tracks
  # attempt counts. A permanent failure (e.g. dependent rows in an unexpected
  # state) keeps the row in `cleanup_status = "failed"` forever, hot-looping
  # the worker. Cap retries here; the worker excludes rows that have hit the
  # ceiling and an operator alert can pick them up.
