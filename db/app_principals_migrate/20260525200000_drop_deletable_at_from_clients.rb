  # `clients.deletable_at` is a legacy alias of `purged_at`. The 2026-05-08
  # `consolidate_retention_on_*` migrations renamed `deletable_at` →
  # `purged_at` on every other table but never reached `clients`. Live readers:
  # none — RetentionPurgeJob, Withdrawal::PersonalDataAnonymizer, and the
  # SignUp services all consult `purged_at`. See
  # adr/retention-lifecycle-column-boundary.md and
  # plans/backlog/retention-vocabulary-drift-cleanup.md.
  #
  # `clients` is a large table; index removal must run CONCURRENTLY. The
  # `remove_column` itself is a metadata-only operation on Postgres 11+ and
  # does not rewrite the table.
