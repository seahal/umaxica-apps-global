# OIDC Claims Decision Memo

## Status

Accepted as the current design direction.

> **Partial supersession (2026-06-02):** The vocabulary and security properties in this ADR remain
> useful, but authority ownership is superseded by `adr/identity-authority-boundary.md`. `acme/www`
> owns session, token, account, preference, authorization, downstream-token trust, and step-up
> freshness. `sign/id` owns only credential inventory and short-lived credential ceremony state.

## Decision

For OIDC-facing identity claims, the repository will use:

- `sub` as the stable subject identifier
- `subject_type` as the explicit category of subject
- `acr` as the current verification level
- `amr` as the methods actually used to establish the current authentication state

`act` is intentionally not used in the OIDC-facing `id_token` in the RFC 8693 sense (delegation /
impersonation actor). The repository does not implement token-exchange delegation.

Separately, `AuthorizationTokenClaims.build`
(`app/controllers/concerns/authorization_token_claims.rb`) emits an `act` claim on the internal auth
access token whose value is the resource type (`client`/`operator`/`visitor`), not an RFC 8693
delegation actor. This reuses a claim name reserved by the RAR/token-exchange vocabulary below for a
private, non-standard purpose and is a known naming collision, not evidence of delegation support.
Any consumer of the auth access token must not interpret `act` as an RFC 8693 actor claim. This
claim is scheduled to be renamed to a non-colliding private name (see Open Questions in
`docs/architecture/preference.md` and the DB SSOT / JWT projection audit); until then, treat `act`
on the auth access token strictly as `resource_type`.

## RAR / Authorization Details Reservation

The repository does not implement Rich Authorization Requests (RAR, RFC 9396) or the
`authorization_details` parameter/claim in this phase.

To leave room for a future standards-aligned RAR implementation, Umaxica private claims, request
params, database columns, service names, and internal APIs must not use RAR-reserved or RAR-like
vocabulary for proprietary semantics. Treat these names as reserved for future standards work:

- `authorization_details`
- `authorization_detail`
- `authorization_data`
- `authz_details`
- `authz_detail`
- `details` when used as a generic authorization payload
- `locations`
- `actions`
- `datatypes`
- `privileges`
- `resources` when used in an RAR-like structure

Use explicit Umaxica or standard OAuth/OIDC names instead. Standard claims and parameters such as
`sid`, `jti`, `client_id`, `scope`, `aud`, `sub`, and `iss` may keep their standard names. Umaxica
private values should prefer names such as `region`, `surface`, `tenant_id`, `roles`,
`permission_version`, `policy_version`, `membership_id`, and `access_mode`. If a private claim could
plausibly collide with a current or future OAuth/OIDC extension, prefix it with `umx_`.

## `id_token` must claims

- `iss`
- `sub`
- `subject_type`
- `aud`
- `exp`
- `iat`
- `auth_time`
- `sid`
- `nonce`
- `acr`
- `amr`

## `id_token` should claims

- `jti`

## `subject_type`

Allowed values:

- `user`
- `staff`
- `customer`

## `acr`

Allowed product AAL boundaries are defined in `adr/authentication-assurance-level-boundaries.md`.
For the current OIDC token paths:

- post-login default is always `aal1`;
- even passkey login starts at `aal1`;
- `aal2` is granted only after explicit verification / step-up;
- refreshed access tokens downgrade to `aal1`;
- `aal3` is reserved and not currently emitted.

## `amr`

Allowed values:

- `email_otp`
- `passkey`
- `apple`
- `google`
- `passcode`
- `totp`

Rules:

- `amr` contains methods actually used
- `amr` does not contain the full set of methods available to the subject
- ordering should prefer primary sign-in method first, then later verification methods

Examples:

- `["email_otp"]`
- `["google"]`
- `["passkey"]`
- `["passcode"]`
- `["email_otp", "totp"]`
- `["google", "passkey"]`

## Difference from current implementation

At the time of writing, the repository already has partial foundations such as:

- `sid` in auth token claims
- refresh token rotation support
- verification/session state models

But the full OIDC claim contract above is not yet consistently implemented across all token paths.

Expected gaps include:

- no final `subject_type` claim rollout yet
- no final `nonce` contract consistently enforced across all OIDC callback/token paths yet
- `acr` / `amr` values not yet normalized to this memo everywhere
- `id_token`-specific behavior still needs to be aligned with these decisions

## Implementation follow-up

This memo should be treated as the design reference for the next implementation pass.
