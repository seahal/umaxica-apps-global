# Runtime kill switch for outbound delivery channels that depend on a third party
# (Amazon SNS for SMS, the SMTP relay for email, APNs/FCM for push).
#
# Polarity is deliberate and the opposite of
# ExternalAuthentication::FlipperProviderAvailabilityAdapter: the feature names a
# *suspension*, so an unset or unknown feature means "not suspended" and delivery runs
# normally. A flag store that has never been written must not take the product's OTP
# delivery down, whereas an operator enabling the flag during a provider incident must
# stop delivery immediately. The authentication adapter faces the opposite risk (a lost
# flag must not let a ceremony through) and therefore reads unset as disabled.
