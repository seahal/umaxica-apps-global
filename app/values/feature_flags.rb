# The single registry of every Flipper feature this application reads.
#
# Two problems motivate it, both observed in this codebase:
#
#   1. A misspelled feature name is not an error. `Flipper.enabled?(:outbund_push_suspended)`
#      returns false forever, so a suspension switch silently never fires and a
#      fail-closed gate silently never opens. Going through `enabled?` here turns
#      an unregistered name into an ArgumentError at the call site.
#   2. Polarity was documented only in prose next to each call site, so "what does
#      unset mean here" had to be rediscovered per feature. It is declared once,
#      per flag, below.
#
# Adding a flag means adding a row here. `Security::Invariants::FeatureFlagRegistryInvariantTest`
# fails if any other file calls `Flipper.enabled?` directly.

  #   :suspension   ON = the effect is stopped. Unset = normal operation (fail-open).
  #                 A flag store that has never been written must not take the
  #                 product down.
  #   :availability ON = the ceremony is permitted. Unset = closed (fail-closed).
  #                 A lost flag must not let an authentication ceremony through.
  #   :rollout      ON = the new implementation runs. Unset = the shipped one.
  #                 A lost flag must not move live traffic onto new code; the
  #                 rollout stalls instead. Removed with the old path.
