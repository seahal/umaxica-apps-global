# Reads one publishing cell for the staff CMS: every entry in the family,
# across locales and both archive states, newest first.
#
# The index is paginated. The public read path
# (`PublishingPublishedEntriesQuery`) has always clamped its page size, while
# this one ordered the whole family and built two URLs per row; a cell is
# unbounded in principle, so the page size is bounded here too.
#
# Offset paging rather than the public path's cursor: this list is ordered by
# `updated_at`, which changes under the reader as entries are edited, so a
# cursor would claim a stability the ordering does not have. A staff operator
# paging through a working list is the case offset paging fits.
