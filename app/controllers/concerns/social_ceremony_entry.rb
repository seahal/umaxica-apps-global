# Surface-neutral entry point for external-identity ceremony start.
#
# The ceremony is POST only. The press of an in-application provider button
# supplies the CSRF token the OmniAuth request phase requires, and the handoff is
# a 307 so that same POST, method and body intact, reaches the request phase
# (OmniAuth.config.allowed_request_methods = [:post]).
#
# There is no GET entry on purpose: a GET carries no token, so a link that
# started a ceremony would be login CSRF (CVE-2015-9284). People choose their
# provider on the sign-in or sign-up page.
#
# This concern holds only what every surface shares: the provider allow-list
# check, the provider availability gate, and the handoff. Everything that
# differs per surface is a hook. The three required hooks raise rather than
# defaulting, because a surface that silently inherited another surface's
# provider list, gate surface, or redirect target would be a cross-surface
# leak (.agents/harnesses/rules/project/surfaces.mdc).
#
# Surface-local extensions:
# - app: AppSocialCeremonyEntry adds sign-up entry detection, ceremony grants,
#   the link/step-up intents, and the ClientSignUpFlow issuance.
# - org: Auth::Org::Social::SessionsController implements the required hooks
#   only; the org surface has no social sign-up at all, because Entra sign-in
#   performs no JIT provisioning (adr/org-entra-id-sign-in-boundary.md).
