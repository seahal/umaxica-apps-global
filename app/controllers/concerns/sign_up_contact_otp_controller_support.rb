# Shared post-OTP progression for the four contact sign-up entry points
# (app/com x email/telephone). Once the contact OTP is verified, the ticket
# has to travel CONTACT_PENDING -> CONTACT_VERIFIED -> GUARDRAIL_PENDING ->
# CHECKPOINT_PENDING and then clear the :otp requirement before any later
# checkpoint step (passkey, passcode, birthdate) is reachable.
#
# The requirement clearing goes through the state machine rather than writing
# `completed_requirements` directly, so the registry membership/order checks,
# the row-level lock and the `checkpoint_version` increment all apply.

    # bumped by a peer between our `enter_checkpoint` and this call is caught.
