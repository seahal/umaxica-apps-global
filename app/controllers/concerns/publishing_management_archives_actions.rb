# The archive state of one entry.
#
# `archived_at` is the only removal this schema has: every association off an
# entry is `dependent: :restrict_with_exception`, and the revisions, versions,
# and publications are the record of what was published. So the CMS has no
# `DELETE /entries/:id`; it has an archive that can be set and cleared.
#
# A singular resource because an entry has one archive state: `create`
# archives, `destroy` restores.
